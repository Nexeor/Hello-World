# Hello-World
First project with the help of Git-Hub tutorial.

This is Tim, creating this project to help post and keep track of the code for my games.
Hopefully I can use Git-Hub to reference others to my code for review and additions.
It will also serve to document what I do and keep me on track as I learn C#.
This project serves to teach me the ropes of Git-Hub using the provided tutorial.
